# Advent of Code 🎄🎁

Welcome to my solutions repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! 🥳 This repository is all about having fun while solving exciting coding challenges during the holiday season. 

## About
Every year, I participate in Advent of Code with my colleagues and friends, competing to see who can solve the puzzles the fastest and most elegantly. The goal isn't just to complete the puzzles but to enjoy the process and improve our skills together.

## Languages Used
You will find solutions written in:
- **Python** 🐍: My go-to for quick and elegant solutions.
- **Rust** 🦀: When performance matters or I want to challenge myself with Rust programming.
- **Golang** 💻: For those times when I need a balance between performance and ease of implementation.

The choice of language depends on:
- The complexity of the problem.
- How much time the solution takes to execute in Python.
- My mood and the challenge I want to give myself.
- Do I have time or not 😅

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific year of Advent of Code (e.g., `2024`, `2023`), with subfolders for each day of the challenge.

```plaintext
.
├── 2024/
│   ├── day1/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   ├── solution.rs

```

## Notes
- The solutions are my personal take on the puzzles and may not always be the most optimal.
- Feel free to explore, comment, or share your ideas!

🎄 Let's celebrate the joy of coding this holiday season! 🎅

Happy Coding.
